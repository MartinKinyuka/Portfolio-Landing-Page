  <div class="why">
    <p>Why programming?</p>
    <p>I like learning new languages.It's one of my goals to become a polyglot.Different languages give you access to new parts of the world/populations. With programming you can learn to communicate with every computer on the planet. If rise of the machine happens I want to be on the side that can speak to T-X.</p>
